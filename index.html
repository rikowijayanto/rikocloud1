   	<h2>1. ITS Goes Global 2017 : Singapore </h2> <!-- Membuat heading 2 -->
   	<p>ITS Goes Global is an program initiated by ITS International Office to support all students to go overseas such as Singapore, Thailand, China, and Malaysia. <br> <!-- Membuat enter -->
   	When I followed this program in 2017, I joined to go to Singapore because in my opinion Singapore <u><b>  <!-- Membuat undeline dan bold -->
   	is the best first for the first traveller </b> </u> because it was my first experience to go out from my beloved Indonesia. <br>
   	Got the full scholarship and could go anywhere were my goal at that time. Okay, let me tell you about that... <br>
   	<b> First, </b> I knew the information from ITS International Office poster shared on my online desk. Look at that pict, <br> <br> </p>

   	<img src="pict1.jpg" width = "400" height="400" border="3" /> <!-- Menyisipkan gambar dalam web --> 
 	</center>

 	<div style="background-color: yellow">
 	<p>
 		As you can see in the picture, that poster was so interesting since it was the chance to go overseas. Oh yeah, I forget, there were so many requirements I had to complete, such as : <br>
 		<ul type="circle"> <!-- membuat bullet dan numbering -->
 			<li>A valid Passport with minimum expired time is six months </li>
 			<li>A copy of student card </li>
 			<li>A <i> Test of English as Foreign Language</i> or TOEFL certificate (valid) </li>
 			<li>A latest one academic transcript </li>
 			<li>Full fill the online registration form</li>

 			
 		</ul>
 		</div>
 		<br>
 		<br>

 		<div style="font-family: arial">
 		<b> Second, </b> After a long time, I forget the correct time, for about two weeks, the first announcement was coming. <br>
 		My name was declared and I had to attend first deep interview. When interviewed by the commite, I was so nervous because there were a lot of participants over there. The transcript (if right) I attach below, <br> <br>

 		<b> Committe</b> : "Good evening, welcome in ITS Goes Global interview session. For the first, please introduce yourself using english! " <br>
 		<b> Me </b> : "Hi, thank you for the chance. I am Riko from Mathematics department and now I am third year." <br>
 		<b> Committe </b> : "Why do you pick this program? What is your motivation?" <br> 
 		<b> Me </b> : "Honestly, I want to get an international exposure through this program. I have a great motivation so I can share to my friends, my communities, and any people about my journey. I am sure that not all people also get the nice chance like me to improve their experience, but my contribution to share my knowledge is needed. The great isn't only in my journey, but all the atmosphere, condition, and spirit. Besides, as the pioneering of the word class university, and I belongs to it, I have to know about global condition. Not only here, but also fly over sky high and high. That's why." <br>
 		<br>
 		<br>
 		<b> Third, </b> As you know, the announcement of the interview had came not to long time. The next session was upgrading session. Upgrading session had been hold using workshop covered. Such as Global Competencies Workshop (GCW) for basic term. The GCW hold on two days, Friday and Saturday respectively. <br>
 		GCW had been opened by Dr. Maria Anityasari as the Head of ITS International Office with all the fire applouse. And GCW had been done well and I graduated from this session.
